## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to assist Dana in adding filters to the UFO sightings website so that users can search by date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Results: 
Below is a screenshot of the updated website. Users can now filter by date, city, state, country and shape.The good thing about it is, that users dont have to search by all filters they can just plug in 1 or 2 values and the results column will automatically update.

## Summary:
One drawback of the webpage is that you have to keep updating the data set everytime new information is received. Two recommendations for further development is having pictures of UFO sightings included and including a filter that would display the frequency of UFO sightings by city.
